<p align="center">Human Gait Data Set</p>  

This data set is first utilized in the following research work:  
QARE：QoE-Driven Intelligent Balance Enhancement for Lower-limb Exoskeleton Rehabilitation Robots, submitted to ACM MM’21.  
Please cite this article when using the data set.  

This human gait data set contains two subsets:    

(1) Angular velocity traces of human walking gaits (with a total of 23398 sets of data collected/calculated via the visual and sensor modalities).   
(2) Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) (with a total of 4800 QoE traces collected when subjects are wearing the lower-limb exoskeleton robot). This QoE sub-dataset is utilized in the LSTM training for personalized gait prediction.
